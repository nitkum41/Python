#1.guessing_game.py


A very simple program for interacting with the user input and checking it for a number randomly generated using guesses.
It uses random module and its application along with building control flow logic for any interactive code.



#2.Code_Breaker_Game.py

A very simple code breaking game . It uses list comprehension and random modules alog with basic control flow logic.
The computer will think of 3 digit number that has no repeating digits.
You will then guess a 3 digit number.
The computer will then give back clues.
Based on these clues you will guess again until you break the code with a
perfect match!

#3.Find_E_to_the_Nth_Digit.py

Calculating value of E (Euler number) using newton's formula / brothers series upto Nth(upto 50) places as asked by user.Using recursion and rounding functions to achieve this outcome.

#4.Find_Pi_to_the_Nth_Digit.py

Calculating value of Pi upto Nth(upto 1000) places as asked by the user using Chudnovsky Algorithm.we use recursion and rounding functions to achieve this outcome.
